# LIE_DETECTOR
ANALOG_PROJECT
  prioject is composed of hardware and software part  
  +for haedware purpose we used darlington analog to find where person is saying truth or lie using voltage differnce in load reisitace 
  +++load resistance is the spot where we place the hand based the resistance value we could perdict where person is saying truth or lie ,the important parameter we consider are humanidity and mositure in hand which indicate the anxiety of person
  
  we get data using csv file using LTspice software or we manual we note the value using kirchhoff's current law and voltage law.
  ++after we get the csv file 
  we import this file to Knime software ,to visalize the tools using decison tree algorithm to predict the output 
  i have attached the implementation workflow of this machine leaning related stuff into it
